# p42-keymap
Personal keymap for my P42 keyboard using QMK firmware and Vial.

This keymap is rarely maintained and should only really be used for reference. The creators' default files don't properly align with the version of this keyboard's matrix, so if half your keys are missing feel free to look at my files or parse around the defaults [here](https://github.com/pabile/qmk_firmware/tree/pabile/keyboards/pabile/p42/promicro/ver2) or [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rkiBh0U8NLGkn-gKoxOfk8Sw-qHc-75h) to find the proper version files for your keyboard.

Vial is used for making changes to the layout easier, learn more about it [here](https://get.vial.today/).
### Note - VIAL_INSECURE is enabled and the UID is my own so you may have to generate another one to get Vial working for you.

## Layers:
> This layout was tweaked over the course of two years through trial and error and still continues to be infrequently modified. Many of the design principles are based on a mish-mish of things scavenged online and personal experiences using this as a daily driver for a number of years.
