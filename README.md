# p42-keymap
Personal keymap for the P42 keyboard using QMK firmware and Vial

This keymap is rarely maintained and should only really be used for reference. The creators' default files don't properly align with the version of this keyboard's matrix, so if half your keys are missing feel free to look at my files or parse around [here](https://github.com/pabile/qmk_firmware/tree/pabile/keyboards/pabile/p42/promicro/ver2) or [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rkiBh0U8NLGkn-gKoxOfk8Sw-qHc-75h) to find the proper version files for your keyboard.
